# Ape-Chit rebuild of Lift Board: architecture (one page)

The storyboard at `storyboard/` is a mock (fixed data, no real logic). This page describes the **rebuild** it previews, and notes where the storyboard already works that way.

## Layout: one bundle, no build step
```
index.html          viewport no-zoom, loads tokens.css, app.css, then the scripts in order below (plain <script>, no bundler)
tokens.css          design tokens (colour, type, space, radii, motion); the only place colours and the logo path live
logic/              pure functions, no DOM. Each sets one global (window.LB.loads, …) so node tests can call it
  loads.js prs.js warmup.js deload.js review.js volume.js   ported UNCHANGED from the current app; diff-tested (below)
  rank.js           ONE ranker: line-for-line port of Coach's tools/rank.py (+ the swap.py / patterns.py parts it calls).
                    BUILT in the storyboard (storyboard/logic/rank.js). Reads every weight, goal label/short/label_note, reason
                    string, favorite boost/margin (0.10), day-theme weight (contexts.*.weights.theme: tray/empty 0.08, swap/preset 0)
                    and volume_bands from rules.json/targets.json/patterns.json/splits.json. Spec order: hard filters (excluded,
                    gym equipment, same day, swap/slot eligibility) -> score -> tie-break -> 1-2 reasons. Swap, tray, empty
                    workout and preset slots all call rank(); the "why" line is r.reasons joined, shown under each row.
                    Parity: `node storyboard/test/rank.diff.js` = 0 mismatches on all 58 ranking-reference.json cases, neutral
                    swap == swap.py swaps() for all 239 exercises, neutral preset == patterns.py slot_recommendations() (72).
                    Python semantics ported exactly (round() ties-to-even on the binary value, stable tuple sorts, dict order).
  swaptags.js       port of tools/swaptags.py diff_tags (swap-sheet lines, priority order, max swap_tags.compare.max_lines)
components/         sheet.js (THE bottom sheet: grab handle, swipe-down close, snap-back), keypad.js (0-9 . ⌫, edits in place,
                    no reflow), swipe.js (swipe-left delete), calendar.js, plates.js (bar picker), musclemap.js (MIT SVG paths)
screens/            train, workout, log, build, progress, settings, learn (index, muscle, fundamental, exercise), style
data/               loaders only: exercises.json, rules.json, targets.json, education/** are read, never written
```
Router: hash routes (`#train`, `#workout`, `#learn-biceps`, `#learn-ex-<id>` …), one delegated click handler, one render per route.

## Design tokens (`tokens.css`)
Black, white and one accent, **Ember #E8430C** (pressed/small text #C2380A, tint #FDECE6). Functional colours: delete red #E5242B,
over-volume amber #F0A830 / red #D93B30 (from targets.json gradient colours). System font stack, type 34/22/17/15/13/11,
spacing 4–32, radii 8/12/16/22, ease cubic-bezier(.32,.72,0,1), 120/240/380 ms. Logo: `--logo-icon`, `--logo-lockup` only
(assets/logo/*-v3, copied from ape-chit-logo/out/).

## Shared rules keys (single source of truth)
- **`rules.json volume_bands`** (CoS, 2026-10-21): amber when weekly sets > max, red when > max × `red_factor` (1.25 today).
  The **volume panel and the body map share this one key** through one function (`vStat` in the storyboard, `logic/volume.js`
  in the rebuild). No factor is hardcoded; if the key is missing nothing turns red. Test `volumeFactorChangeFlipsPanel` rewrites
  the factor to 1.5/1.1 and checks both surfaces follow.
- `rules.json swap_tags` — swap-sheet wording ("Typical differences, not guarantees.").
- Display bands for ratings (Coach, a model): main ≥ 0.75, helper 0.4–<0.75, minor 0.25–<0.4, not counted < 0.25.

## Suggestions UI (ranking-spec §8b, approved by CoS)
- Tray: segmented **Suggested** (default, `rank('tray', candidates)`) / **Library** (exercises.json order). Search and filter chips are
  hard filters in both modes and stay on `equipment` labels. Each suggestion has a 1–2 reason line directly under it, never a popup.
- Settings goals: multi-select up to `goal_combine.max_goals` (3) with Coach's labels and `label_note` footnotes from rules.json;
  `goal_conflicts` show as a flag with Coach's message and evidence badge.
- Gym profile `equipment: {token: bool}` over **rules.json `equipment_items`** (36 tokens, labels, groups, `implies`, `legacy`):
  Settings > Gyms > Home gym shows one checkbox per token, grouped, with Coach's labels; the full map is saved on the first edit.
  "Start from: **Home template** / **Commercial template**" (`example_profiles`) only pre-ticks boxes; the user ticks what the gym
  actually has, and the templates' example loads (e.g. their dumbbell sets) are never copied into the user's gym.
  rank.js `needsStatus` = rank.py `needs_status`: with no map, or an exercise without `equipment_needs`, the old `equipment` status
  applies (neutral parity); otherwise every need must be met, `a|b` = either, a token is met if ticked, implied by a ticked broader
  token (adjustable_bench -> flat_bench, ghd -> hyperextension_bench) or, if unset, by the loads fields via `legacy`; unknown tokens
  keep the exercise with note `equipment_unknown`. Unavailable = hard filter in every context. Chips and labels keep using `equipment`.
  Exercise pages show Coach's "Needs:" line (`equipment_needs.text`). Template check: Home leaves 60 of 239 exercises, Commercial 220.
- Data freeze: the storyboard reads its own copies in `storyboard/data/` first. `sync-education.sh` copies Education only;
  `sync-ranking-data.sh` copies rules/exercises/targets/patterns/splits/ranking-reference **once per Coach "done" post**, then rerun the diffs.

## Education (Learn) — data-driven, no per-page code
- Book icon in the Train/Build/Progress headers (no 5th tab). Entries: tap the muscle map, the (i) on an exercise, exercise links.
- `education/index.json` drives the index: `status:"final"` pages render, `"planned"` show "Coming soon". All 23 pages (19 muscles,
  4 fundamentals) are final. Every map path resolves to a page; heads (`region_ids`) are drawn either as their own path or via the
  group path (`g:chest`, `g:triceps`, `g:calves`, as in the live map). The two back `ABDUCTOR_*` paths have no region in the live map
  either and are drawn as non-interactive outline.
- Citations resolve in `references.json`, then `references-exercises.json`; badges Supported / Mechanics / Model; DOI links.
- **Exercise pages** (`#learn-ex-<id>`, Coach's exercise-pages-spec.md): `education/exercises/index.json` lists authored pages; a
  `final` entry loads `exercises/<path>`, otherwise the **fallback is `exercises/auto/<id>.json`**, shown with its
  "Auto-generated from the exercise library" banner. Live ratings come from exercises.json; alternatives link to their own pages.
  All 56 preset exercises have authored pages (index all final; test `allPresetExercisesOpenAuthoredPage`); the other exercises use
  auto pages. **Storyboard: ships Coach's static auto/*.json files as-is (no runtime generation).** **Rebuild: ports `tools/gen_exercise_autopages.py auto_page()`
  (with exercise_pages.py, swaptags.py, swap.py) to `logic/exercise-pages.js` and generates auto pages at runtime from
  exercises.json; Coach's auto/*.json become test fixtures only — a test generates all of them and deep-compares (0 mismatches),
  and the auto files are no longer shipped.** Authored pages always win.

## State and storage
localStorage, existing keys kept so nobody loses data: `liftboard.logs`, `.routines`, `.mysplits`, `.logSettings`, `.logActive`,
`.logTimer`, `.custom`, `.exNotes`, `.bodyweights`, `.deload`, `.staged`, … New: favourites (ordered), goals, bias muscles
(storyboard mock keys `apechit.sb.favs|goals|bias`). One `storage.js` owns reads/writes, **export/import** (single JSON file with a
schema version) and **migration** on load: `LOG_SCHEMA=2` logs and the legacy `liftboard.v1` blob are upgraded in place, once,
with a backup key written first.

## Tests
- `tests/run-all.sh` keeps running; the parity diffs (`*diff.js`, e1rm, logger, swapc …) call the logic globals instead of the old
  page, so ported modules must match the current app byte-for-byte on the fuzz boards. `mutate.sh` mutants must still be caught.
- New reference diffs: `rank.js` vs ranking-reference.json + swap.py/patterns.py neutral (done, 0 mismatches), `swaptags.js` vs tools/swaptags.py,
  (rebuild) exercise-pages.js vs the auto/ fixtures (deep-compare all, 0 mismatches).
- UI tests are rewritten against the new screens (Playwright WebKit, iPhone 13), like `storyboard/test/sb.test.js`.
- Coach's validators stay the gate for data: `tools/check_education.py`, `tools/check_exercise_pages.py` must print PASS.

## Clean-up
Delete the ~67 versioned / `pre-*` / `bak-*` / `*.vNN.*` files in the app root (and the old vNN test files); git history in
lift-board-site keeps them. sw.js cache list shrinks to the bundle.
